  <a href="/">This presentation</a> was created by <strong>Marcin Wichary</strong> and modified by many people in the <em>Google Chrome team</em>
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of the presentation is to show the coming bleeding edge features for modern desktop and mobile browsers.
</p>
<p>
  The presentation was originally meant to run in <strong>Google Chrome</strong>. Some experimental features <strong>might or might not</strong> be coded to run in other browsers for now. (Although you will cry out of happiness when you see so much running in IE with the Chrome Frame plug-in)
</p>
<p>
  If you want to run 100% of the demos contained in the presentation you might need to run <a href="http://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/dev-channel">Developer Channel Chrome</a> or <a href="http://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs">Google Chrome Canary</a> (on Windows).
